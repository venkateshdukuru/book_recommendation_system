- **List Books**: Retrieve a list of all available books.
- **Get Book by Index**: Fetch book details using its index in the collection.
- **Get Book by ID**: Retrieve book details using its unique ID.
- **Random Book**: Get a random book from the collection.
- **Book Recommendations**: Recommend books based on a given book name, considering both the name and genre.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for backend development.
- **FastAPI**: Framework for building APIs quickly and efficiently.
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library used for implementing the KNN algorithm.
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management using Python type annotations.
- **Mangum**: Adapter for running FastAPI applications on AWS Lambda.

## Installation
